# 🌿 Code That Saves Carbon

### Empowering Sustainable Agriculture through AI-driven Insights

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

*Code That Saves Carbon* is an intelligent agriculture web platform that integrates crop disease detection, soil analysis, and carbon savings estimation.  
By helping farmers make better decisions on crop health, soil quality, and supplements, it actively contributes to *reducing agricultural carbon emissions* and improving yield sustainability.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Agriculture contributes to nearly *26% of global greenhouse gas emissions*.  
A major portion comes from inefficient fertilizer usage, poor soil management, and crop losses due to undiagnosed diseases.  
Our solution empowers farmers and researchers to *track and reduce carbon emissions* through smart data-driven insights.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

The platform integrates:
- *AI-powered crop disease detection* using deep learning (PyTorch)
- *Soil parameter identification* based on geolocation (latitude & longitude)
- *Weather data integration* for real-time recommendations
- *Carbon savings calculator* to visualize how sustainable farming reduces emissions

Together, these modules enable smarter agricultural practices that lower CO₂ output and increase productivity.

## 🧩 What Makes It Unique

Unlike standard farming dashboards, our system combines:
- *AI-driven disease recognition*
- *Live soil & weather analysis*
- *Carbon savings estimation*
- *Visual impact charts*  
into a single, seamless web app designed for farmers, NGOs, and researchers.
